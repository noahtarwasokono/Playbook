Configure Network IP, Gateway, Primary and Secondary DNS (Kali, Ubuntu, CentOS)

**FOR KALI**
1. ip a (check network, find interface)
2. sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces (get to interfaces)
3. auto eth0 (replace with interface)
4. iface eth0 inet static
5. (tab) address .../netmask, netmask, gateway, dns-nameservers (space after each new address)
6. sudo systemctl restart networking 
7. ip a (again, ensure all addresses are in there), ip route can use to check default gateway
