1. Check `.bashrc` for malicious aliases, `source ~/.bashrc` to enable changes
2. Change your default password: `passwd <username>` will let you do this
3. Check users: look in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` for users that shouldn't be there and can them. `userdel <username>`
4. Check groups: `/etc/group`
5. Check cronjobs: `/etc/crontab` is a file containing all running cron jobs. You should also check all the directories `/etc/cron.*` that are mentioned in the `crontab` file
6. Check SSH files: `cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and just make sure there aren't any malicious keys in there. The black team will give us their authorized key
7. Check system binaries for files with suspicious names like `redteam`, `red_herring`, `dropbear`, `watershell`


Change default passwords
Remove bad users
Remove bad SSH keys
Give only certain users SSH access
Go through the conf files
Back up everything you can

`/etc/passwd`: Check if a user has `nologin` or `/bin/bash`
`/etc/shadow`: Check if a user has a hash
	If a user has `username:*:...`, they have no login
	If a user has `username::...`, they have no password
If you see a malicious user 

Pins: `/etc/apt/apt.conf` `/etc/apt/sources.list` `/etc/apt/preferences` `/etc/apt/preferences.d/`
Also you should turn on logging, which is usually `rsyslog` or `rsyslogd`
